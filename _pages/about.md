As an Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University Qatar, I have been fascinated by the intersection of computer science and artificial intelligence. My passion for these fields has driven me to pursue learning and researching in the areas of natural language processing (NLP) and computer security.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for spreading knowledge beyond the confines of the field. I believe that sharing knowledge and discovering applications of computer science outside of the traditional realm is vital in advancing the field and promoting its importance.

During my free time, I enjoy indulging in my other interests, including watching anime and playing computer games. These activities provide me with a much-needed break from the rigors of academic study, and allow me to refresh my mind and approach problems with a fresh perspective.
