I am an undergraduate student at CMUQ interested in Natural Language Processing, as well as Computer Science. I am very interested in field which computers challenges human behaviors,also have a passion to spread knowledge to more people- not only computer sciences but also security awareness and many other topics as well. Outside of academics, I enjoy computer gaming and anime.
