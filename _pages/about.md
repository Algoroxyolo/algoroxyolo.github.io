As an Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University Qatar, I have been fascinated by the intersection of computer science and artificial intelligence. My passion for these fields has driven me to pursue learning and researching in the areas of natural language processing (NLP) and Computational Social Science.

My research journey has been incredibly enriching, marked by noteworthy collaborations and impactful projects. During my time at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), I had the privilege of working closely with [Dr. Firoj Alam](https://firojalam.one/). His mentorship granted me insights into the world of Arabic NLP, leading to contributions in stance classification and fake news detection. At Carnegie Mellon University Qatar, my collaboration with [Prof. Houda Bouamor](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/hbouamor/)opened doors to exploring the intricacies of language. In particular, I focused on the intricate task of detecting "Abstract language" ("抽象话"), a type of encoded offensive language within Chinese text. This highlighted my dedication to unraveling complex linguistic phenomena. These research experiences underline my unwavering commitment to expanding horizons and making meaningful contributions in the realm of computer science and natural language processing.

As an undergraduate student at CMU-Q, I've made impactful contributions to our academic and student communities. I designed and taught "NLP Ethics in a Nutshell," focusing on the ethical aspects of Natural Language Processing. I'm also a committed Course Assistant, helping fellow students grasp complex concepts in 15-110, offering detailed assignment feedback, and refining my pedagogical and Python skills. As a Curriculum Support Developer, I've played a key role in shaping our academic landscape, curating question banks, and creating an intuitive web app. My skills in Markdown, database management, information retrieval, and Python programming have grown.
