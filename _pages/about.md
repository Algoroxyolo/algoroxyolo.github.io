I am a highly motivated undergraduate student at CMUQ with a strong interest in Natural Language Processing and Computer Science. I am fascinated by the field of computer science where machines can challenge human behaviors and solve problems that are difficult for humans to solve alone. Apart from that, I also have a passion for spreading knowledge and awareness about various topics, not just limited to computer science but also security, health and many more. I believe that technology can be a great tool to empower people with knowledge and create a better world for everyone.

In my free time, I enjoy computer gaming and watching anime. These hobbies have taught me the importance of attention to detail, strategy, and creativity which are all crucial skills in the field of computer science. I believe that these skills can be applied to problem-solving and can contribute positively to my research work.
