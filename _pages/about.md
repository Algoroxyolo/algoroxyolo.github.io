As an Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University Qatar, I have been fascinated by the intersection of computer science and artificial intelligence. My passion for these fields has driven me to pursue learning and researching in the areas of natural language processing (NLP) and Computational Social Science.

My research journey has been rewarding, marked by collaborations and impactful projects. At Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), I closely worked with [Dr. Firoj Alam](https://firojalam.one/), gaining insights into Arabic NLP, contributing to stance classification and fake news detection. At Carnegie Mellon University Qatar, alongside [Prof. Houda Bouamor](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/hbouamor/) , I focused on detecting "Abstract language" ("抽象话"), an encoded offensive language in Chinese text, showcasing my dedication to linguistics. These experiences underline my commitment to computer science and natural language processing.

As an undergraduate student at CMU-Q, I've made impactful contributions to our academic and student communities. I designed and taught ["NLP Ethics in a Nutshell"](https://algoroxyolo.github.io/assets/pdf/NLP_Ethics.pdf),shedding light on comtemporary ethical discussions. As a Course Assistant, I help in [15-110](https://web2.qatar.cmu.edu/cs/15110/#staff), refining pedagogical and Python skills. As a Curriculum Support Developer, I shaped academics, curating question banks and an intuitive web app. Formerly the Head of Academic, I bridged faculty and student concerns for collaborative solutions.
